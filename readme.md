Playground for me to learn. 
Checking out new features in Laravel, expirmenting with TDD, Vue.js


You can find the front-end in `website/` directory.

I originally had the front-end in a separate repository, but considering the
simplicity of the app, I prefer to have it in here.

Instead of migrating everything over into Laravel, (updating the root
package.json, moving everything over into resources/, etc) I find it easier to
just create a directory with the project already in there, isolated and
separate.

This way it's together in the same repo, but not coupled directly to the Laravel
app. 


Laravel is fine for this, but it's kinda heavy for a simple app.

I'd probably prefer Symfony or Go instead.

If I wanted to be REALLY fast, I'd use Phalcon (I'll check it out at somepoint I
swear)

## TODO
- Admin dashboard.
- Docker (Maybe use this as a pet project for kubernetes too).
  - Setup WebSockets + Laravel Echo.
