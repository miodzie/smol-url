## tiny-url

Playground for me to learn. 
Checking out new features in Laravel, expirmenting with TDD, Vue.js


You can find the front-end [here](https://github.com/miodzie/smolurl-vue/).


Laravel is fine for this, but it's kinda heavy for a simple app.

I'd probably prefer Symfony or Go instead.

If I wanted to be REALLY fast, I'd use Phalcon (I'll check it out at somepoint I
swear)
