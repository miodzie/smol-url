## URL Shortener

Playground for me to learn. 
Checking out new features in Laravel, expirmenting with TDD, and
eventually Vue.js


Laravel is fine for this, but it's kinda heavy for a simple app.

I'd probably prefer Symfony or Go instead.

If I wanted to be REALLY fast, I'd use Phalcon (I'll check it out at somepoint I
swear)
